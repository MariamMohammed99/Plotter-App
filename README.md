## Features

### Plotting Data

Plotter App allows users to input data dimensions and measures to generate line charts. This feature enables visualization and comparison of multiple measures over the given dimension.

### Adding Dimensions and Measures

Users can easily add dimensions and measures to the line chart. By dragging them from the sidebar into the respective sections, users can customize their charts to suit their analysis needs. Each line on the chart represents a measure, while the dimension is used for categorization.

### Deleting Measures

Plotter App provides users with the ability to delete measures from the line chart. Whether you've added multiple measures or just one, you can delete them individually or all at once with a single click. This feature enhances flexibility and ease of data exploration.

## Data Analysis

Plotter App serves as a valuable tool for data analysis. By visualizing data trends through line charts, users can gain insights and make informed decisions. With the capability to plot multiple lines on the same graph, along with distinct colors and legends for each measure, users can effectively track and analyze various data sets. This feature empowers users to identify patterns, trends, and correlations within their data, facilitating informed decision-making processes.

Enjoy analyzing your data with Plotter App!
